# Balunbox
A box for a 1:4 ( 50 ohms unbalanced to 200 ohms balanced ) balun composed of  TX58/41/18-4C65 cores.
Its possible to add a third, as a extra choke if needed. 

I know that someone will insist that 1:4 is wrong,
and it should be written 4:1. The issue I have with that is the way we write, so the antenna side is on the right side, and the unbalanced coax on the left side.
That way the coax "faces" the start of the sentence.
As a European the 4:1 feels backwards and ackward.
If you don't agree and feel that it needs to be corrected,
fork this repository and do so.

Windings:
The 1:4 guanella balun will need two TX58/41/18-4C65 cores with 16 turns bifilar #16 single core transformer wire, or PTFE silver covered multi strand wire.  
The extra choke needs a TX58/41/18-4C65 or a FT240-61 or a FT240-XX core with 17 turns 50 ohms PTFE coax for maximum current choking.

There are STL files for 3D printing. PETG is recommended.

Toroid holders:

Should handle up 2000 W 160 meters to 6 meters.

You will need suitable bolts, two 4 mm banana tie posts, a SO-239 coax connector, soldering iron and 16# wire as mentioned.
Instant gasket or similar.

How much choking impedance one can expect from the choke alone:

 TX58/41/18-4C65 is similar to mix 61.

BEWARE ! Printing this will use around 80 meters of PETG filament and several hours of printing !
The toroid holders only, that can be superglued inside a suitable box is here:
https://github.com/Supermagnum/Balunbox/tree/main/toroid-holder
Those are a lot faster to print, and should not consume that enourmous amount of filament.
