# Balunbox
A box for a 1:4 ( 50 ohms unbalanced to 200 ohms balanced ) balun composed of  TX58/41/18-4C65 cores.
Its possible to add a third, as a extra choke if needed. 

Windings:
The 1:4 guanella balun will need two TX58/41/18-4C65 cores with 16 turns #16 PTFE silver covered multi strand wire.  
The extra choke needs a TX58/41/18-4C65 or a FT240-61 or a FT240-XX core with 17 turns 50 ohms PTFE coax for maximum current choking.

There are STL files for 3D printing. PETG is recommended.

Should handle up 2000 W 160 meters to 6 meters.

You will need suitable bolts, two 4 mm banana tie posts, a SO-239 coax connector, soldering iron and 16# ptfe multistrand wire.
Instant gasket or similar.

 TX58/41/18-4C65 is similar to mix 61.
